// If you like more challenges, here is a harder verion of this Kata.
// Four Color Theorem
// In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that,
// given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map,
// no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
// Adjacent means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a corner where three or more regions meet.
// It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer.
// Fig. 1: A four-coloring of a map of the states of the United States (ignoring lakes).
// While every planar map can be colored with four colors, it is NP-complete in complexity to decide
// whether an arbitrary planar map can be colored with just three colors.[1]
// For some cases, even three colors are not required, for example two colors are enough to distinguish the squares on a chessboard.
// Task
// Find the minimum amount of colors needed to fill a map with no neighboring territories having the same color.
// Input
// The test map will be inputed as a string. For example the map below has 9 different territories.
// It needs 3 colors to seperate them. Usually there is more than one way to color a map.
// A possible color pattern for the map below is:
// Color 1: A, C, D, H
// Color 2: B, b, E
// Color 3: F, G
// `
// AABBCC
// AABBCC
// bbDDEF
// bbDDGH
// `
// Input Notes:
// The territory names are case sensitive, B and b are different territories;
// Territories are considered adjacent only if they share an edge, A is adjacent to B, but Not D;
// One territory is always connected, there are no discrete islands;
// Chars of ASCII 33~126 will be used (see...no 32)
// Inputs are always rectangular, ignore tailing spaces if any
// Output
// The output should be an int, which is the minimum amount of colors needed to fill the map.
// More about the tests:
// There are 45 fixed tests and 200 random tests.
// Fixed tests are not necessarily easier, they include some special cases.
// Please do Not Hard Code them;
// Maps can be big. If we call the sample input above a 6x4 = 24 pixel map, a large map in random tests could have about 5,000 pixels;
// All tests will have no more than 10 territories;
// There are no oceans or seas which need a certain color, i.e. blue;
// Some maps have one territory only;
// The oldie but goodie: you will find more in sample tests.
// Here are more examples:
// Input strings:
// 1) "ABCD"   2) """    3) """
// AAA       AAAA
// ABC       ACCA
// DBC       DBCA
// """       """
// A is adjacent to B; B is adjacent to C; C is adjacent to D; Your code should return 2;
// A is adjacent to all the other 3, but C is not touching D; Your code should return 3;
// B is not adjacent to A anymore; Your code should return 2;
