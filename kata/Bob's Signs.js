// Overview
// You need to help Bob be a good businessman and not charge people too much for his signs.
// Description
// Bob is running a business that creates signs for people.
// He can charge much less than his competitors because he charges by letter instead by the entire sign.
// He can take a sign and change a few letters to make a new sign much more cheaply than a competitor can make a sign from scratch.
// The only problem is Bob is not very good at pricing these changes.
// He wants to be able to look at a sign and a customer's request and quickly be able to give the customer an estimate for the total cost.
// Task
// Write a class SignMaster that is able to help Bob estimate prices quickly.
// Bob will need to be able to changePrices(prices) so that he can adapt to the changing market.
// He also needs to estimatePrice(oldSign, newSign) so that he can give his price estimates to his customers.
// The changePrices method takes an object that specifies the new prices.
// The values are the cost of doing an operation (add or remove) and the keys will be add or rem depending on the operation.
// Bob does not always want to change the price for both adding and removing letters, so this method should handle incomplete input.
// Before this method is called, the sign changes should be free.
// estimatePrice takes two strings.
// The first string is the old sign of the customer and the second is their request.
// This method should return the cost of changing the sign from the old message to the new message.
// If there are multiple ways to change the sign, this method should return the cheapest way.
