// Description:
// Given an unsorted array arr that contains some positive integers. It may be one of the following:
// 1. There are numbers 1 to n, only one number is duplicate(repeated two times), the other numbers are unique.
// That is, there are n+1 elements in the array e.g. [1,2,3,6,5,4,1]
// 2. There are numbers 1 to n, only one number is unique, the other numbers are repeated two times.
// That is, there are 2*n-1 elements in the array e.g. [1,2,3,1,2,3,4]
// Your task is to determine the type of the array, if it is the first type, to return the duplicate; if it is second type, return the unique.
// Note:
// All numbers are positive integers that from 1 to n;
// The length of array always more than 5;
// Please pay attention to optimizing the code to avoid time out.
// Some Examples
// input                                output
// 	[1,2,3,6,5,4,1]                      1
// 	[1,2,3,1,2,3,4]                      4
// 	[3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,8,7]                8
// 	[9,8,7,1,2,3,9,7,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,6,6]  8
